# Chapter 5 PyBer_Analysis

# Challenge 5

# Overview:

The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary dataframe that tracks a company called PyBer's cab fares by city type(Urban, Suburban or Rural) and then eventually plots the 
data using a multiple-line graph. 

# Results:

When looking at the summary data, we can see that while the average fare per ride in Urban settings is the lowest, since the demand is so much higher in urban areas the revenue to
the company is much greater. The inverse is true for rural areas in that the average fare per ride is very high, there is simply not as much demand so the overall revenue is much
lower. Suburban areas are in the middle of these two extremes.



This can be visualized better with the multiple line graph produced here that shows total revenue vs time for each of the 3 city types.



# Summary:

There are 4 points in the line graph that should be investigated further. 

1. As can be seen, each type of city has a peak in the 3rd week of February. 
2. Rural and urban both have another peak in the first week of April
3. Urban areas have another peak in the second week of March.
4. Suburban total fares went up towards the start of May

We should be investigating these peaks to maximize revenue amongst the 3 city types, either by reducing prices in order to increase demand or raising the prices a bit if the 
demand would still be static.
